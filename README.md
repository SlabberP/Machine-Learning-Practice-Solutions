### Dataset: Car Insurance Claim Prediction

#### Source of the data:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sagnik1511/car-insurance-data 


#### Brief Description of the data:
Context:

The company has shared its annual car insurance data. Now, you have to find out the real customer behaviors over the data.

Content
The columns are resembling practical world features.
The outcome column indicates 1 if a customer has claimed his/her loan else 0.
The data has 19 features from there 18 of them are corresponding logs which were taken by the company.

#### Target:
The target is the 'Outcome' column which is a binary classification answer.

#### Data:
This is business data

#### Problem:
This is a classification problem. The outcome column indicates 1 if a customer has claimed his/her loan else 0.

#### Features:
The data consists of 19 features.

#### Rows :
The dataset consists of 10000 rows.

#### Challenges with cleaning the data:
I need to decide to remove some of the features and also Which inconsistencies exists. This could be a challenging dataset but it is close to a real world example as one can get.

### Second Choice - Dataset 2: Adult income dataset

#### Source of the data:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wenruliu/adult-income-dataset

#### Brief Description of the data:
Context
An individual’s annual income results from various factors. Intuitively, it is influenced by the individual’s education level, age, gender, occupation, and etc.

Content
The columns are resembling practical world features.
The data has 19 features from there 18 of them are corresponding logs which were taken by the company.

#### Target:
The target is the 'Income' column which is a binary classification answer.

#### Data:
This is census data

#### Problem:
This is a classification problem. The income is divide into two classes: <=50K and >50K.

#### Features:
The data consists of 16 features.

#### Rows :
The dataset consists of 48842 rows.

#### Challenges with cleaning the data:
I need to decide to remove some of the features and also Which inconsistencies exists. This could be a challenging dataset but it is close to a real world example as one can get.
